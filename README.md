# ts-creator-script

This [bash script](https://github.com/GuilhermeSCP/ts-creator-script/blob/master/make-stream.sh) aims to build separated audio and video TS files from one source, ready to mux for transmission.

I created this since I found it very difficult to create those TS files without loosing quality and, most of all, loosing audio and video synchronization. I also provide some basic DVB tables so you can mux your own TS file, using OpenCaster tools, for example.
